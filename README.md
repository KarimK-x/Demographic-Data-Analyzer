# Project outline
### Navigating through the files
**It's fairly simple there are only three files:**
- test.py : *A file for testing the program, run test.py first to see what the program does before checking out source code*\
- main.py : *My main source code containing all the functions as well as their implementations*\
- DemoJupyter.ipynb : *Interactive jupyter notebook to properly display all the answers to the questions as well as plots using matplotlib.pyplot*\

## Project Details
### Inspired by freecodecamp certification project
#### Given a csv file with demographic data, use Pandas to answer the following questions:

  - How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
  - What is the average age of men?
  - What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
  - What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
  - What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
  - What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
  - What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
  - What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
  - Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.
  
### Extra
**I added on to the task assigned by freecodecamp and made graphs answering each question as well, later on will add more charts that display other conclusions from the dataset**
